# Cybersecurity Internship - Task 2: Analyze a Phishing Email Sample

## Project Overview

This repository contains the results and documentation for "Task 2: Analyze a Phishing Email Sample," completed as part of the Cyber Security Internship with Elevate Labs. The objective of this task was to identify phishing characteristics in a suspicious email sample. The deliverable is a report listing the phishing indicators found.

## Tools Used

* Email Client or Saved Email File (text): To access and view the phishing email sample.
* Free Online Header Analyzer: To check email headers for discrepancies and glean additional information about the email's origin and path.

## Process Followed

The task was executed by following the "Hints/Mini Guide" provided in the task document.

1.  Obtain a Sample Phishing Email: A sample phishing email was obtained (e.g., from public resources or a controlled environment).
2.  Examine Sender's Email Address for Spoofing: The sender's email address was carefully checked for any signs of spoofing (e.g., mismatched domain, unusual characters).
3.  Check Email Headers for Discrepancies: The full email headers were analyzed using a free online header analyzer to look for inconsistencies in sender information, mail routes, or other suspicious details.
4.  Identify Suspicious Links or Attachments:The email body was scrutinized for any suspicious links (without clicking them) or attachments.The presence and nature of these elements were noted.
5.  Look for Urgent or Threatening Language:* The language used in the email body was reviewed for common phishing tactics such as urgency, threats, or emotional manipulation.
6.  Note Any Mismatched URLs: For any links present, the displayed URL was compared against the actual URL (by hovering over it) to detect any mismatches or redirects to malicious sites.
7.  Verify Presence of Spelling or Grammar Errors: The email content was checked for unusual spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, or awkward phrasing, which are common indicators of phishing attempts.
8.  *Summarize Phishing Traits Found:* All identified phishing indicators were compiled and summarized in a report.

## Interview Questions & Answers

The following questions were addressed as part of the task, demonstrating understanding of key email security and phishing concepts.

1.  What is phishing?
          Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers attempt to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information (like usernames, passwords, credit card details) or performing actions (like clicking malicious links, downloading malware) by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications, often emails.

2.  How to identify a phishing email?
        Phishing emails can often be identified by several indicators, including suspicious sender addresses, generic greetings, urgent or threatening language, mismatched URLs, spelling and grammar errors, and unexpected attachments or requests for sensitive information.

3.  What is email spoofing?
    Email spoofing is the creation of email messages with a forged sender address. Attackers use this technique to make emails appear as though they originate from a legitimate source, thereby deceiving the recipient into trusting the message and taking requested actions.

4.  Why are phishing emails dangerous?
          Phishing emails are dangerous because they can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, data breaches, and malware infections.By tricking recipients into revealing credentials or executing malicious code, attackers can gain unauthorized access to accounts, systems, and sensitive information.

5.  How can you verify the sender's authenticity?
        To verify a sender's authenticity, you can check the full email headers for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records, which help validate the sender's domain.You can also directly contact the purported sender via a known legitimate channel (not by replying to the suspicious email) to confirm the message's legitimacy.

6.  What tools can analyze email headers?
        Various free online tools can analyze email headers, such as Google Admin Toolbox Messageheader, MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer, and tools provided by email security vendors.These tools parse the raw header information into a more readable format, highlighting key details and potential discrepancies.

7.  What actions should be taken on suspected phishing emails?
      If an email is suspected of being a phishing attempt, it should not be clicked, replied to, or have any attachments opened. Instead, it should be reported to your IT security department or email provider, and then deleted. If sensitive information was accidentally compromised, passwords should be changed immediately.

8.  How do attackers use social engineering in phishing?
    Attackers use social engineering in phishing by manipulating recipients' emotions (e.g., fear, urgency, curiosity) or trust to trick them into performing actions that benefit the attacker.They craft compelling narratives that exploit human psychology, making the phishing email seem legitimate and prompting an immediate, unthinking response.

## Image describes
üìß Suspicious sender ‚Äì Email address doesn‚Äôt match the claimed organization.

‚ö†Ô∏è Urgent or threatening tone ‚Äì Pressures you to act quickly.

üîó Mismatched links ‚Äì Hovering reveals a different URL than shown.

üìé Unexpected attachments ‚Äì Especially from unknown senders.

üßæ Grammatical errors ‚Äì Poor language often signals fraud.

üö® Why Phishing Awareness Matters
Prevalence: Over 80% of cyberattacks begin with phishing.

Impact: It can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and data breaches.

Deceptiveness: Phishing emails often look legitimate, making them hard to detect without training

üõ°Ô∏è Key Awareness Tips
Verify the sender: Always check the email address, not just the display name.

Hover before you click: Inspect links before clicking‚Äîmismatched URLs are a red flag.

Watch for urgency: Phishing emails often create panic to rush your decision.

Check for errors: Typos and awkward grammar are common in phishing attempts.

Don‚Äôt trust attachments blindly: Especially if unexpected or from unknown sources.

This project focuses on analyzing email headers to detect phishing and spoofed emails using SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication results.

üîç What is Email Header Analysis?

Email headers contain metadata that helps track the origin, authentication, and delivery path of an email. Analyzing these headers helps identify suspicious or malicious activity, especially phishing.

‚úÖ Key Authentication Checks

SPF (Sender Policy Framework):
Verifies if the sender's IP is authorized to send mail for the domain.

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):
Ensures email content and sender identity weren‚Äôt altered using cryptographic signatures.

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance):
Combines SPF & DKIM results with alignment policies to validate authenticity.


üõ° Use Case
Helps security analysts:
Detect spoofed or forged sender addresses
Identify malicious email sources
Enhance phishing incident response

üìÇ How to Use
1. Extract full headers from a suspicious email.
2. Parse the following fields:

  -Received-SPF
  -DKIM-Signature
  -Authentication-Results
  -Return-Path, From, Received

3. Compare domains and check SPF/DKIM/DMARC results.
4. Flag inconsistencies or failed authentications.

üìå Example Output

SPF: FAIL (sender not permitted)
DKIM: PASS
DMARC: FAIL (domain misalignment)
‚Üí Warning: Potential phishing attempt
